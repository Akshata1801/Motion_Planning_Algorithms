This repository contains the basic search algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search algorithms
The Algorithms are implemented in python.
The Algorithm are tested on simple maze built in python.



### Running the Algorithms

Each python files consists of the main class which is the starting point of python code.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Akshata1801/Motion_Planning_Algorithms.git
$ On command line type $python a_star.py
```
## Results
 For better visualisation it is recommended to run the code in Spyder editor.
 Guide to install spyder can be found [here](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html)
 
 ## Additional Details
 For better understanding, refer to Report.docx file in the repository for short explaination of the algorithms as well to get a feel of how the output is generated.
